A very rudimentary implementation of Monopoly.

This was written back in mid-1991.  It was my first "major" project using
C++.  I like to think my C++ has come a long way since then.

I can't even try to build it anymore because I don't run Windows, but if you
had an old enough Borland C++ compiler environment, you might be able to.
